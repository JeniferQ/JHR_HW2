#  The PlayStation Timeline 
To demonstrate our knowledge of OOP, modules, and bundling based on what was covered in class, we created an application showcasing the evolution of Sony's PlayStation console over the years. For this, we used GreenSock to create dynamic animations and applied the concepts learned in class to control the gallery and display text. The goal was to provide an overview of each console and highlight how they revolutionized the market with their innovations and games.
